//When the web browser reads our HTML file it creates the web page,
//including all of the buttons and other elements in the html.

//This code uses a FUNCTION named querySelector on the DOCUMENT
//object to find two element, the button and the count.

//let score = document.querySelector("#score");

//A totally normal variable
//let scoreCount = 0;

//A totally normal function...
//function theyClickedTheButton() {
  //It increments the counter variable. Remember that counter++
  //is shorthand for counter = counter + 1
  //counter++;

  //This is new, it sets the text inside the count element
  //to the value of the counter. This changes the number on
  //the web page!
 // count.innerText = counter;
//}

//This is new! It tells the button to CALL the "theyClickedTheButton"
//function every time the 'click' event happens.
//button.addEventListener("click", theyClickedTheButton);

//So now that all of this has run the web browser is set up to
//CALL that function every time the button is clicked.
